# tap ‚Äì Terminal Audio Player

A fast, Rust-powered CLI music player for the terminal, with a built-in fuzzy finder (fzf-style) to quickly browse and play your audio library.

Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows), fully configurable, and lightweight, tap delivers powerful playback and search features in a minimal, distraction-free TUI.

## üéß Usage

```bash
> tap [options] [path]
```

By default, `tap` starts in the **Finder view**, where you can search your music library.

- Selecting an album switches to the **Player view** and begins playback.

- You can reopen or cancel a search at any time without interrupting current playback.


### üîç Example

```bash
> cd ~/path/to/my_music
> tap
```

If no path is specified, `tap` defaults to the current working directory.


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Direct Playback

To skip the Finder and start playback immediately, launch tap with a file or album path:

```bash
> tap ~/path/to/my_album
```

## `>` Command-line Options

Option                  | Description
---                     |---
`--sequential`          | Traverse files sequentially (instead of in parallel). Can improve startup time on older systems, virtual machines, network drives, or HDDs.
`-d`, `--default`       | Run from the default directory, if set.
`-p`, `--print`         | Print the path of the default directory, if set.
`-s`, `--set`           | Set a default directory. Requires a `tap.yml` config file.
`-b`, `--term-bg`       | Use the terminal background color.
`-t`, `--term-color`    | Restrict colors to the terminal‚Äôs background and foreground only.
`-c`, `--default-color` | Ignore any user-defined colors and use defaults.
`--color <COLOR>`       | Apply a custom color scheme. See [Colors](#colors) for available values.
`--cli`                 | Run in CLI mode (disable the TUI; audio only).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration


tap doesn't create the config file for you, but it looks for one in the following locations:

- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tap/tap.yml
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tap.yml
- $HOME/.config/tap/tap.yml
- $HOME/.tap.yml

A example config file can be found [here](https://github.com/timdubbins/tap/blob/master/doc/tap.yml).

### `‚Üí` Keybindings

Keybindings for the player can be set in the config file. You can bind multiple keys to an event.

### üé® Colors

Colors can be set in the config file or using the ```--color``` command.

The following example will set a [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) theme:
```
--color fg=268bd2,bg=002b36,hl=fdf6e3,prompt=586e75,header_1=859900,header_2=cb4b16,progress=6c71c4,info=2aa198,err=dc322f
```

### `/` Default Path

The default path can be set in the config file. This allows you to load the default directory with the `-d --default` command and also provides faster load times by caching.

When setting a default path tap will write a small amount of encoded data to `~/.cache/tap`. This is guaranteed to be at least as small as the in-memory data and will be updated everytime the default path is accessed. Using the `-s --set` command will update the `path` field in the `tap.yml` config file.

Without setting a default path tap is `read-only`.
