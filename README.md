## Usage

```bash
> tap [options] [path]
```

### Fuzzy-Finder

Run `tap` in a directory containing music folders to launch the fuzzy-finder:
```bash
> cd ~/path/to/my_music
> tap
```
Playback will begin on selection and you can return to the fuzzy-finder by pressing `Tab`.




If no `path` is specified, `tap` defaults to the current working directory.

### Direct Playback

To skip the fuzzy-finder and directly open an audio file or album:

```bash
> tap ~/path/to/my_album
```

## Configuration


tap doesn't create the config file for you, but it looks for one in the following locations:

- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tap/tap.yml
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tap.yml
- $HOME/.config/tap/tap.yml
- $HOME/.tap.yml

A example config file can be found [here](https://github.com/timdubbins/tap/blob/master/doc/tap.yml).

### Colors

Colors can be set in the config file or using the ```--color``` command.

The following example will set a [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) theme:
```
--color fg=268bd2,bg=002b36,hl=fdf6e3,prompt=586e75,header_1=859900,header_2=cb4b16,progress=6c71c4,info=2aa198,err=dc322f
```



### Default Path

The default path can be set in the config file. This allows you to load the default directory with the `-d --default` command and also provides faster load times by caching.

When setting a default path tap will write a small amount of encoded data to `~/.cache/tap`. This is guaranteed to be at least as small as the in-memory data and will be updated everytime the default path is accessed. Using the `-s --set` command will update the `path` field in the `tap.yml` config file.

Without setting a default path tap is `read-only`.
